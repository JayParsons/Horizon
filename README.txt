CSCI 4168 Final Project

Horizon
Created by: Jason Parsons

This is a game being created in Unity3D as the final project for CSCI 4168 (Game Design and Development). Horizon is a combination of 3D and 2D game designs. The 3D portions are meant to be an arcade style shmup set in 3D. These space shooter sequences are broken up by 2D sections set aboard a variety of space stations. These stations contain an array of NPC characters to converse with. These conversations allow for player choice, and will allow for a deeper narrative to what would ordinarily be a straightforward action game.

The project began in the last two weeks of October, and is due on December 5th of this year. Thus, the project in its current state is a work in progress. This README file will be updated accordingly as each phas of the project progresses.

Current state:

Currently I have created a prototype of one of the flying sequences in the scene 'Level1'. This is my attempt at getting a simple unity object to fly in 3D space surrounded by a starfield. The starfield is being randomly generated by a script attached tot he main camera.

Current issues:

There is an issue with the starfield in which any stars generated that are outside the view of the frustum never appear visible when the camera is turned towards them.

Current game controls:


To control the ship, the following commands are currently in place.

Up Arrow: Moves the ship and camera forward
Down Arrow: Moves the ship and camera in reverse
W Key: Moves the camera up
S Key: Moves the camera down
A Key: Rotates the ship and camera left
D Key: Rotates the ship and camera right
